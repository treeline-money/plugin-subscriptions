Automatically finds recurring charges in your transaction history and shows you exactly what you're spending on subscriptions.

## How it works

The plugin scans your transactions for recurring patterns - Netflix every month, Spotify, your gym membership, that app you forgot you signed up for. It groups them together and calculates what you're actually spending.

## What you'll see

- **Monthly cost** - Total subscription spending per month
- **Annual cost** - Projected yearly total
- **Year-to-date** - What you've actually spent so far this year
- **Frequency detection** - Weekly, monthly, annual - it figures it out
- **Stale subscriptions** - Charges that stopped appearing (maybe you cancelled?)

## Getting started

Once installed, the plugin appears in your sidebar. It automatically analyzes your transaction history - no configuration needed. You can hide items that aren't actually subscriptions, or manually tag transactions to include them.
